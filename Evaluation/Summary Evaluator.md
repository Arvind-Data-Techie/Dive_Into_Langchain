The provided Python code is part of a larger project that uses the `langsmith`, `langchain`, and `langchain_community` libraries. It's designed to evaluate the relevance of a retrieved document to a user's question and calculate the F1 score of the evaluation.

The code begins by importing necessary modules and classes from these libraries. It then initializes a `ChatOllama` instance named `llm` with the model "mistral" and format "json". `ChatOllama` is a chat model from the `langchain_community` library.

```python
llm = ChatOllama(model="mistral", format="json", temperature=0)
```

Next, a `PromptTemplate` is created. This template is used to instruct a grader on how to assess the relevance of a retrieved document to a user's question. The template takes two input variables, "question" and "document".

```python
prompt=PromptTemplate(
template='''You are a grader assessing relevance of a retrieved document to a user question. \n
    ...
    Provide the binary score as a JSON with a single key 'score' and no premable or explaination.''',
input_variables= ["question", "document"])
```

The `PromptTemplate` is then piped into the `ChatOllama` instance and a `JsonOutputParser` to create `retrieval_grader_mistral`. This object is used to invoke the grading process.

```python
retrieval_grader_mistral = prompt | llm | JsonOutputParser()
```

The `predict_mistral` function takes a dictionary of inputs and uses `retrieval_grader_mistral` to grade the relevance of the document to the question. It returns a dictionary with the grade.

```python
def predict_mistral (inputs: dict) -> dict:
    grade = retrieval_grader_mistral.invoke({"question": inputs ["question"], "document": inputs ["doc_txt"]})
    return {"grade": grade ['score']}
```

The `f1_score_summary_evaluator` function calculates the F1 score based on a list of runs and examples. It counts the true positives, false positives, and false negatives, and then calculates the precision, recall, and F1 score.

```python
def f1_score_summary_evaluator(runs: List[Run], examples: List[Example]) -> dict:
    ...
    f1_score = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
    return {"key": "f1_score", "score": f1_score}
```

Finally, the `evaluate` function from the `langsmith.evaluation` module is called with `predict_mistral` as the classifier, "Relevance Grading" as the data, and `f1_score_summary_evaluator` as the summary evaluator.

```python
evaluate(
    predict_mistral, # Your classifier
    data="Relevance Grading",
    summary_evaluators=[f1_score_summary_evaluator],
)
```

This code is a good example of how to use the `langsmith`, `langchain`, and `langchain_community` libraries to create a document relevance grader and evaluate its performance.
